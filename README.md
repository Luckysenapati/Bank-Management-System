# Bank-Management-System
Bank Management System project

The project is a **Bank Management System** developed using **Java** and **MySQL**, designed to facilitate various banking operations through a user-friendly graphical interface. The system comprises multiple components that handle user authentication, account creation, and transaction management.

## Project Overview

### Core Features

1. **User Authentication**:
   - The system includes a login interface where users can enter their card number and PIN to access their accounts. If the credentials are correct, they are directed to the transactions page; otherwise, an error message is displayed[1].

2. **Account Registration**:
   - New users can sign up through a multi-page registration process. The first page collects personal details like name, date of birth, and gender. The second page gathers additional information such as religion, income category, and educational qualifications. The final page may include further details necessary for account creation[1].

3. **Database Integration**:
   - The application uses MySQL for data storage, ensuring that user information and transaction records are securely managed. SQL queries are utilized to insert, update, and retrieve data from the database, facilitating operations such as account creation and user authentication[1].

4. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**:
   - The system employs Java Swing to create an intuitive GUI. This includes various components like buttons, text fields, and labels, providing a seamless user experience. The interface is designed to be visually appealing and easy to navigate[1].

### Technical Implementation

- **Java Swing**: Utilized for building the GUI, allowing for the creation of responsive and interactive components.
- **MySQL**: Serves as the backend database for storing user data and transaction records.
- **Event Handling**: The application implements action listeners to handle user interactions, such as button clicks for logging in, signing up, and clearing input fields[1].

### Conclusion

This Bank Management System is a comprehensive solution for managing banking operations efficiently. By leveraging Java for the application logic and MySQL for data management, the system ensures reliability, security, and ease of use for both new and existing customers. The multi-step signup process and robust authentication mechanisms contribute to a secure banking environment, making it suitable for real-world applications.
